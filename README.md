# CMS Pitch Tracking & Design (Fall 2025)

This project aims to improve the performance of one CMS pitcher by analyzing and redesigning a specific pitch using Rapsodo/Trackman data, in-game results, and MLB comps.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Capture baseline pitch metrics and in-game results
- Identify adjustments to shape, usage, and sequencing
- Track progress over time using modeled performance indicators

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `/data/`: Google Sheet exports and raw pitch metric CSVs  
- `/scripts/`: R Markdown notebooks for modeling & visualizing pitch data  
- `README.md`: This file  
- `.gitignore`, `renv.lock`: Dependency tracking and version control setup  

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Google Forms/Sheets** for intrasquad tracking
- **Rapsodo** for baseline pitch metrics
- **R (RStudio)** for modeling, visualization, and analysis
- **GitHub** for version control

## 👨‍🔬 In Progress

- [x] Set up Google Form + Sheet
- [x] Configure R project, renv, and GitHub
- [ ] Write modeling script for Trackman data
- [ ] Create heatmaps and whiff-rate visualizations
